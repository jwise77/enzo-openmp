Welcome to Enzo's documentation!
================================

This is the development site for Enzo, an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR),
grid-based hybrid code (hydro + N-Body) which is designed to do simulations of
cosmological structure formation. Links to documentation and downloads for all
versions of Enzo from 1.0 on are available. 

Enzo development is supported by grants AST-0808184 and OCI-0832662 from the
National Science Foundation.
