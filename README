== COMPILING ==

   Note, this assumes that GNU make on your platform is called "make".
   This is not necessarily true on operating systems that ship with
   their on version of make (e.g., AIX). You may need to replace
   the "make" commands with "gmake".

   0.  Run "./configure" from the top-level Enzo directory

   1.  Change directory to "src/enzo"

   2.  Look at the "Make.mach.*" files to find one for your target
       architecture.

   3a. If an appropriate "Make.mach.<machine> file is found, then run

          % make machine-<machine>

       to select it.

   3b  Otherwise, if no appropriate "Make.mach.<machine>" file is
       found, then create an empty one using
       
          % cp Make.mach.unknown Make.mach.<machine>

       and editing it.  Note that the <machine> part of the machine
       file by convention is of the form <site>-<platform>.  For
       example, "Make.mach.sdsc-datastar" for the platform DataStar at
       SDSC.

       Edit your newly-created Make.mach.<machine> file by filling in
       the variable settings to those for the new target machine.

   4.  To compile Enzo, from the amr_mpi/src directory, type 

          % make
